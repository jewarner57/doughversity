## Doughversity

### What is doughversity?
* Doughversity was created to help bakers sell their confections and connect users with locally owned bakeries around the country.

* In the world of mail order cookies variety is practically non existent. The same 4 websites sell the same 4 cookies. There is an opening for strong variety and we plan to take it by creating an online platform where small bakeries can advertise their businesses and sell their products easily to a wide audience across the nation. We aim to empower locally owned bakers and bring their high quality confections to the world.  

* We are currently building:
  * An online storefront where small bakers can sell their goods online to a wide audience.
  * Monthly subscription boxes containing unique, bakery made cookies from up to a dozen different bakeries.
