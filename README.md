## Doughversity

### What is doughversity?
* The doughversity service is designed to help bakers sell their cookies and connect users with cookies from locally owned bakeries around the country.

* Our web service will initially provide monthly subscription boxes containing unique, bakery made cookies from up to a dozen different bakeries. We will expand to offer an online storefront where small bakers can sell their goods online to a wide audience free of charge.
