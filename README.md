## Doughversity

### What is doughversity?
* Doughversity was created to help bakers sell their cookies and connect users with cookies from locally owned bakeries around the country.

* Our web service will initially provide monthly subscription boxes containing unique, bakery made cookies from up to a dozen different bakeries. 

* We will then expand our service to offer an online storefront where small bakers can sell their goods online to a wide audience free of charge.
