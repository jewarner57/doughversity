        <ul>
            <li>Doughversity was created to help bakers sell their cookies and connect users with cookies from locally
                owned
                bakeries
                around the country.</li>

            <li>In the world of mail order cookies variety is practically non existent. The same 4 websites sell the
                same 4 cookies.
                There is an opening for strong variety and we plan to take it by creating an online platform where small
                bakeries can
                advertise their businesses and sell their products easily to a wide audience across the nation. We aim
                to empower
                locally owned bakers and bring their high quality confections to the world.</li>

            <li>We are currently planning to offer:
                An online storefront where small bakers can sell their goods online to a wide audience.
                Monthly subscription boxes containing unique, bakery made cookies from up to a dozen different bakeries.
