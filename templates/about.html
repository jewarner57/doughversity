        <ul>
            <li>Doughversity was created to help bakers sell their cookies and connect users with cookies from locally
                owned
                bakeries
                around the country.</li>

            <li>Our web service will initially provide monthly subscription boxes containing unique, bakery made cookies
                from up
                to a
                dozen different bakeries.</li>

            <li>We will then expand our service to offer an online storefront where small bakers can sell their goods
                online
                to
                a wide
                audience free of charge.
